there’s this thing in ny called Open Studios and it’s when all artists open up their personal studios for people to tour so a 50 block radius in brooklyn turns into a huge art exhibit.  we can bring that on a digital scale. be it’s own digital museum
The Problem we are going to solve:   no need for the politics in trying to contract w a museum or gallery
     Example: like spotify or apple music or bandcamp… you can upload your own music instead of trying to get a record deal for them to publish it
The person: catered to the indie / undiscovered artist… we can look at the mona lisa all we want but the undiscovered talent in montana, we can give them a platform

Are there problems to be solved? 
These can be simple! Do you struggle with picking a venue for a fun night out? Do you know someone who is frustrated with job hunting or finding a roommate? 
Who does it affect? 
Really get in the shoes of the user: What do they do for a living? What community do they belong in?
How can a website solve those problems?
Don’t worry if your idea isn’t unique
